Are you planning to hire more people to handle growing workload?

Before you do, run this calculation:

Our new ROI calculator shows you exactly how much you could save by automating repetitive tasks instead of adding headcount.

### Post 2: Professional Services Case Study
```
"We were planning to hire another finance person. Instead, we invested in automation and our existing team now handles 3x the volume."

A 45-person professional services firm was spending 35+ hours weekly on invoice reconciliation.

We automated the workflow between their CRM and accounting system.

Results:
• 80% time reduction
• £28,800 annual savings
• 2.2-month payback
• 548% Year 1 ROI

Same team. Zero new hires. 3x capacity.

### Post 3: SaaS Lead Qualification Story
```
Your sales team shouldn't spend 45 minutes researching every lead that comes through your website.

A 28-person SaaS company was drowning in 200+ monthly leads. They had no way to prioritize. Conversion rate stuck at 8%.

We built an AI-powered qualification system that:
✓ Scores every lead automatically
✓ Enriches company data 24/7
✓ Routes hot prospects immediately
✓ Delivers complete briefing packs

Result: Conversion rate jumped to 18%. Sales team focuses only on qualified opportunities.

### Post 4: E-commerce Cart Recovery
```
72% cart abandonment rate = £180K in lost annual revenue.

That was the reality for an 18-employee e-commerce retailer.

We built a multi-channel recovery system (email + SMS) with:
• Dynamic incentive engine
• Urgency triggers
• Inventory awareness
• Automated across 1,200+ monthly carts

Recovery rate: 23%
Recovered revenue: £41K annually
Cost to run: ~£500/month

That's an 82x return working 24/7 without human intervention.

See the breakdown: [link to #case-studies]
