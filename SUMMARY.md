## 💰 Revenue Impact Potential

### **Website Conversion Funnel:**

**Conservative Scenario (Current State):**
- 500 monthly visitors → 2% convert to discovery calls = 10 calls
- 30% book Blueprint Workshop = 3 workshops @ £1,500 = £4,500/month
- 50% of workshops convert to implementation = 1.5 projects @ £15K avg = £22,500/month
- **Total monthly revenue: £27,000**
- **Annual projection: £324,000**

**With Enhanced Website (12 months out):**
- 1,000 monthly visitors (2x traffic from content marketing)
- 5% convert to discovery calls (2.5x improvement from ROI calculator + case studies) = 50 calls
- 40% book Blueprint Workshop (improved qualification) = 20 workshops @ £1,500 = £30,000/month
- 60% convert to implementation (better-qualified leads) = 12 projects @ £18K avg = £216,000/month
- **Total monthly revenue: £246,000**
- **Annual projection: £2,952,000**

**Difference: £2,628,000 annual revenue increase**
